Partners register with you for showing your advertisements and you pay them on a Cost-Per-Click basis. They provide you with a list of URLs and you give them an html snippet to put on their pages. The product gives you elementary dashboards for viewing impressions and clicks of a page URL to calculate payout amount.\r\n\r\nThe partner URLs thus registered with us will be crawled at regular intervals to find out the context of the pages such as city name[1]. When that page is loaded on the browser, the relevant advertisements are chosen in realtime and shown on the page.\r\n\r\nDeployment steps:\r\n\r\n    Execute the file db.sql on a MySQL database server with hostname 'database.mysql'. Change the database connection credentials in persistence.xml.\r\n\r\n    Configure rules of ad selection in the table 'ad_selector_rules' and create ads in the table 'advertisement'.\r\n\r\n    Build the project using maven and deploy on a web container like Tomcat on a server with hostname 'adnetwork.api'. Register partner URLs with the application using the rest endpoint {HOST}/adnetwork/register.\r\n\r\n    On the partner site, insert the html listed in the file 'partner-integration-snippet.html'.\r\n\r\n    You can see the number of impressions and clicks for a URL u on the endpoint {HOST}/adnetwork/dashboard?pageUrl={u}\r\n\r\n[1] Jenny Rose Finkel, Trond Grenager, and Christopher Manning. 2005.
